Custom Extensions
-----------------

With my work on Cassandra, I needed some custom extensions; so i forked the source code made the extensions and rebuilt
the binary for my use.

Extension: GZIP-Base64 Datatype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For size advantages - we compress the text data in Text/UTF-8 columns in cassandra. The text is GZIPed and then Base64
encoded - result is stored in Cassandra.

When we peek into the data using Cassandra-Cli - the data we see is not clear text - this benefit is lost because of
the compression. Hence I added this extension which indicates to Cassandra that the data in the text column
is GZIP-Base 64 encoded,the value is decoded and displayed when queried.

.Usage
Lets assume that the employee column family has address column in compressed format.
Execute the following assumption.
----
ASSUME employee VALIDATOR AS GZIPBASE64;
----
Post this the output of the address column will be in clear text. The data type is implemented in such a way that it detects
if compression has been performed only then does it uncompress the data. This relieves the user of indicating, in the above
example that only address column is compressed and others are not.
