Custom Extensions
-----------------
We needed some custom extensions (listed below) for cassandra; so I forked the source code made the extensions and rebuilt
the binary for our use.

Extension: GZIP-Base64 Datatype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For size advantages - we compress the text data in Text/UTF-8 columns in cassandra. The text is GZIPed and then Base64
encoded - result is stored in Cassandra.

When we peek into the data using Cassandra-Cli, the data we see is not in clear text - this benefit is lost because of
compression. Hence I added this extension which indicates to Cassandra that the data in the text column
is GZIP-Base64 encoded. The extension will decode the value and display the result in clear text when queried.

*Usage*

Let's assume that the +employee+ column family has +address+ column data in compressed format.
Execute the following assumption in Cassandra-Cli.
----
ASSUME employee VALIDATOR AS GZIPBASE64;
----
With this assumption the output of the +address+ column will be in clear text. The +GZIPBASE64+ type is implemented 
in such a way that it detects data for compression, only then decodes it. 
If no compression is performed, the data is not altered. 

This implementation relieves the user of indicating, in the above
example that only +address+ column is compressed and others are not.
